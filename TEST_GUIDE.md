# 🧪 Testing Guide for Fixed Collapsible JSON Functionality

## 🚀 Test Setup Complete

✅ **Extension compiled successfully**  
✅ **VS Code opened with extension in development mode**  
✅ **Test server running on http://localhost:3001**

## 📋 Test Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Complex Nested JSON Test**
1. **Open the extension** in VS Code (Ctrl+Shift+P → "REST Test: Send Request")
2. **Set URL**: `http://localhost:3001/test/nested`
3. **Method**: GET
4. **Click Send**

**Expected Result**: You should see a complex JSON response with multiple nesting levels.

**🔍 What to Test:**
- [ ] Top-level objects (`user`, `posts`, `settings`) should be expandable/collapsible
- [ ] Nested objects like `user.profile.address.coordinates` should work independently
- [ ] Array items in `posts` should collapse/expand properly
- [ ] Deep nesting like `posts[0].metadata.comments[0].replies[0].reactions.details` should work
- [ ] Toggle icons (▼/▶) should rotate correctly
- [ ] Collapsing a parent should hide children but preserve their internal state

### **Scenario 2: Array with Nested Objects**
1. **Set URL**: `http://localhost:3001/test/array`
2. **Click Send**

**🔍 What to Test:**
- [ ] Array items should be individually collapsible
- [ ] Nested objects within array items should work independently
- [ ] Each array item's state should be independent

### **Scenario 3: Simple JSON Test**
1. **Set URL**: `http://localhost:3001/test/simple`
2. **Click Send**

**🔍 What to Test:**
- [ ] Simple objects should still work correctly
- [ ] No unnecessary collapse controls on primitive values

## 🎯 Specific Nested Collapse Tests

### **Test A: Parent-Child Independence**
1. Navigate to the nested JSON response
2. Expand `user` → `profile` → `preferences` → `notifications` → `settings`
3. Collapse `notifications` (parent)
4. Expand `notifications` again
5. **Expected**: `settings` should still be in its previous expanded state

### **Test B: Deep Array Nesting**
1. Navigate to `posts` → `[0]` → `metadata` → `comments` → `[0]` → `replies`
2. Expand `replies[0]` → `reactions` → `details`
3. Collapse `replies[0]` 
4. Expand `replies[0]` again
5. **Expected**: `reactions` and `details` should maintain their state

### **Test C: Multiple Parallel Branches**
1. Expand both `user.profile.address` and `user.profile.preferences` 
2. Collapse `user.profile`
3. Expand `user.profile` again
4. **Expected**: Both `address` and `preferences` should remember their expanded states

## 🐛 Issues to Look For

### **Before the Fix (Issues that should be RESOLVED):**
- ❌ Nested elements conflicting with parent collapse states
- ❌ Toggle icons not rotating correctly
- ❌ Child elements losing their state when parent is toggled
- ❌ Inconsistent behavior between arrays and objects
- ❌ Visual glitches or elements not responding to clicks

### **After the Fix (Expected Behavior):**
- ✅ Clean, independent collapse/expand for each level
- ✅ Consistent toggle icon rotation (▼ = expanded, ▶ = collapsed)
- ✅ State preservation for child elements
- ✅ Smooth visual transitions
- ✅ No conflicts between different nesting levels

## 🔧 Quick Commands for Testing

```bash
# Complex nested data
curl http://localhost:3001/test/nested

# Array with nested objects  
curl http://localhost:3001/test/array

# Simple response
curl http://localhost:3001/test/simple
```

## 📊 Test Results

After testing, verify:
- [ ] All nested collapse/expand operations work smoothly
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in VS Code Developer Console
- [ ] Toggle icons behave correctly at all nesting levels
- [ ] State preservation works as expected
- [ ] Performance is good even with deep nesting

## 🎉 Success Criteria

The fix is successful if:
1. **Independent Operation**: Each nesting level operates independently
2. **State Preservation**: Child states are preserved when parents are toggled
3. **Visual Consistency**: Toggle icons and animations work correctly
4. **No Conflicts**: No interference between different parts of the JSON tree
5. **Performance**: Smooth operation even with deeply nested data

**Happy Testing! 🚀** 

The collapsible JSON functionality should now work flawlessly with nested data structures.
